    <p>Jonathan Dowd loves learning about HTML and CSS but hates writing about himself. This paragraph and the following one are just filler material for the homework assignment we currently have. I've lived in West Philadelphia all my life.
        I'm a fan a all the local sports teams but especially the 76ers annd the Eagles. My Hobbies include photography, video games, and running.</p>

        <br>
    <p>I'm also interested in Manga currently reading One Piece and Boku no Hero Academica. Aside from this class and the work I like try to find time for gaming. Recently bought a Nintendo Switch but haven't had much time to play it yet.</p>
